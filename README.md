# algo-interpretation

This repo contains my attempts to interpret transformers trained to solve algorithmic problems like those in LeetCode.

# Algorithm Problems
So far, this repo contains one investigation--that for a transformer trained to solve the Majority Element problem. Please see the `majority_element.ipynb` file for details.

# Requirements
The code here requires TransformerLens and CircuitsVis. Install them with the following commands:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/neelnanda-io/TransformerLens.git@new-demo
pip install circuitsvis
```
